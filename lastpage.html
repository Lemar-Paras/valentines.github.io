    <div id="thankyou"><b>Thank you for being my beautiful girlfriend. I made this special page just for you, with effort and love, because I want you to feel how special you truly are and how much you mean to me.

While I was working on this, my niece shared something simple but meaningful. She said that when you give a gift to someone you love, it should always come with effort and love. Funny how we sometimes learn the best lessons from the youngest ones, hehe.

So I made this page not just as a gift, but as a small piece of my heart. I want you to know how much I love you, how grateful I am for you, and how happy I am to have you in my life.

And with all that love, I want to ask you something special.
Will you be my Valentine this coming Valentine’s Day?  Here’s a special flower made just for you, my lovey Erphyllee. </b></div>
